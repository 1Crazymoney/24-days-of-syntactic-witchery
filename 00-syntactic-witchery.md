# 24 days of syntactic witchery
*aligning characters for fun and profit, with Haskell and PureScript*

In this "24 days ofâ€¦" I want to focus on tricks and patterns that are (at least to some extent):

- expressed using a relatively simple machinery
- capture some idea in a concise, but not necessarily intuitive way
- non-obvious, but can be discovered by accident or striking of bright idea
- neat in their own way
- mostly ungooglable

Some of these are widely used in every other codebase, others pop up occasionally in the dark corners. Some are charming, but when used inappropriately can seed confusion and havoc.

Even though the title has 'syntactic' in it, I'll steer away from talking about plain usage of syntactic sugar and GHC's syntactic extensions since they are already very well documented in [GHC User's Guide][ghc-syntactic-xtensions] and excellent [24 Days of GHC Extensions][24-days-of-ghc-extensions].

This by definition is a work in progress. I don't yet have a full list of things to write about, which means that the topics won't be ordered very meaningfully and I might start running out of good ideas by the end it'll turn into reference for `lens` package.

Guest posts are very welcome, and don't have to be in Haskell/PureScript as long as they fit the idea.
